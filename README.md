# DIGITAL-FORENSICS-PRACTICALS
This repository holds personal projects involving hands-on tasks that are crucial in investigating cybercrimes and analyzing digital evidence. This is to enhance my skills on how to handle, recover, and analyze data from different digital devices (e.g., computers, smartphones, servers) to uncover potential evidence.
I will be performing practical exercises like;
   1. Disk Imaging and Data Acquisition
       To create a bit-for-bit image of a storage device to preserve its integrity.
        Tools: Guymager, FTK Imager
   2. File System Analysis
        To analyze file systems (FAT, NTFS, EXT) to recover deleted files or identify 
                   suspicious activity.
        Tools: Autopsy, FTK Imager
   3. Network Traffic Analysis
       To analyze network traffic to detect unauthorized access or malicious activity.
       Tools: Wireshark, Zeek

Prerequisites
tools and software installed:
  Guymager (for disk imaging)
  Wireshark (for network traffic analysis)
  FTK Imager (for forensic imaging)
  Autopsy (for file system analysis)
  Cuckoo Sandbox (for malware analysis)
  Python 3.x (for scripting and automation tasks)
  Virtual Machine (VM) or a forensic workstation (recommended for safe experimentation)
